THE FC EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK 20 minutes

As an Operations Manager, it’s important to know the basic rules and policies that help keep
the club running smoothly. You are a leader, and your team will look to you for answers when
it comes to following the rules, consistency in applying them and demonstrating what good
looks like.

* FC Handbook: All the important rules and policies you need to know are in the Fitness
Connection Employee Handbook. This handbook is a great resource for both you and your
team.

¢ Where to Find It: You and your teammates can find a copy of the Employee Handbook in
Paycom by following these steps:

Go to Documents > Completed > Fitness Connection Employee Handbook

We will review portions of the handbook throughout your training as they related to different
topics. The Handbook is your guide post to making fair and consistent teammate decisions.
Let's look at the Cell Phone/Mobile Device Use/Recordings policy to see how that works!

ACTIVITY: EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK

1. Log into Paycom and navigate to your copy of the Fitness Connection Employee Handbook
2. Review the Cell Phone/Mobile Device Use/Recording policy on page 10

3. Answer the questions below

You have a teammate, Jake, who has disclosed a potentially urgent situation to you as the
manager. They are repeatedly on their cell phone texting or talking behind the front desk

throughout the shift. Based on the Employee Handbook, is this acceptable behavior according
to FitCo guidelines? Why or why not (use specific wording in the policy to defend)?

POSITIVE SPECIFIC FEEDBACK s0 minutes

Give great feedback is the cornerstone of leading a shift, leading a team, and ultimately
leading your club. Every behavior, action, and interaction of every teammate is a chance for you
to provide feedback.

Learning to seize those opportunities takes practice. During your ClubWork shifts, you'll
practice providing meaningful feedback when teammates are performing well and focused on
achieving their goals and honest, constructive feedback when teammates need to improve.

Positive, specific feedback is the first element of great coaching. Tell the teammate, in-the-
moment, specifically what they did well. ‘Amazing job asking the right questions to match
that member with a new supplement to help him out!" or "Thank you for following up with that
member to get her past due amount collected while getting her re-energized about our new GX
class!" or "Thank you for leading the charge on Team Cleans today, your energy to get the team
rallied made a big difference in club cleanliness and energy in the whole club!"

Vague feedback, like "Great Job!" or "Nice Teamwork" or "Good job hitting your goals today"
doesn't really tell your team WHAT you liked about WHAT they did. People are more likely to
repeat and action if they are recognized for it, so go ahead. Tell them WHY they rock and they
will do it again and again!

ACTIVITY: POSITIVE SPECIFIC FEEDBACK

Take a few minutes to ‘upgrade’ the feedback statements below: The first one is done for you.

"Thank you for going above ana beyona with
1. Thanks for the great shift today! training Corey today, you were really pattent
with questions and still hit every EPIC greet!"

2. Great job with ProShop!

3. Good work hitting your
target today

4. Really good member interaction!

5. Nice teamwork!

PERFORMANCE IMPROVING «Sminutes
FEEDBACK

Performance improving feedback given during the shift, in-the-moment, is the best way to
adjust skills and correct behaviors as they happen. Your team will be open to performance
improving feedback from you as long as you practice these FOUR things:

1. Keep giving them positive specific feedback for the things they do well separate from the
performance improving feedback

2. When you deliver performance improving feedback, be specific, honest, and direct
3. Focus on the skill or behavior, never the person

4. The feedback is from YOU, not your boss, not corporate, not "other people’, just you

ACTIVITY: PERFORMANCE IMPROVING FEEDBACK

Review the Performance Improving Feedback below. Next to each statement, write 1, 2, 3 or 4
(or multiple numbers) for the number of the practice above that was NOT followed.

MANAGING VS. LEADING 30 minutes

As an Operations Manager, it's important to understand the difference between being a
manager and being a leader. Both roles are important, but being a leader goes beyond just
managing tasks—it’s about inspiring and guiding your team to success.

A manager focuses on making sure tasks get done, while a leader motivates and inspires the
team to do their best.

G.R.O.W. CONVERSATIONS 45 minutes

In-the-Moment feedback, like the positive specific and performance improving feedback you
have been working on is the first, best way to recognize and correct teammate behaviors
and actions. Sometimes, however, that in-the-moment feedback does not lead to sustained
improvement. As a manager, the next tool in your toolbox is a G.R.O.W. conversation.

Goal - What is our goal? State the desired result you expect the
teammate to achieve. Be specific.

One thing at a time, stay focused
Focus on the topic, not the person
Ensure clarity around goal/standard/behavior

Reality - What is actually happening? Describe behaviors & actions
you observed from the teammate. Provide specific examples.

Be ready with one or two specific examples
Refer back to the goal/standard/behavior as needed

Obstacle - Ask the teammate what they believe is getting in the
way of the desired result. Ask them what they can do to remove the
obstacle(s). Do not give them the answers!

Ask open-ended questions
Focus them toward obstacles that are in their control (or that you can help remove)
Ask, ‘what else?’

Way Forward - What is our way forward? Ask the teammate to tell you
what they will commit to moving forward. Let them know when you
will be checking in.

The Way Forward needs to be their plan, not yours

Is it realistic based on the starting point?
How will you follow up and check in and how often?

MOTIVATION 30 minutes

In your current role, earlier role, earlier job (different company) or even back in school, think
about some times you felt motivated? How about de-motivated.

Reflecting on those times you felt motivated above, what types of things, activities or
situations motivate you? (Think for a few minutes, then write down ALL of the things that
motivate you.)

Ask that question to 10 different people and you are likely to get 10 different answers.
WHY because motivation is a personal thing. So how do we as leaders motivate our team?
Simple, we watch, we listen and most importantly, we ASK them. Then, we DO SOMETHING
with that information.

There are two main categories of motivation, internal (intrinsic) and external (extrinsic). As
leaders, we should do our best to understand our teams’ internal motivators. Understanding
them can help us maximize our opportunities to put our teammate in a situation where they
are motivated. Internal motivators have the MOST long term impact and success.

Examples include: ability to contribute; opportunity to learn something new; a desire to help
others

Which of the motivators that you wrote down earlier are internal?

What work situations make you feel those types of motivation?

External motivation, sometimes referred to as the carrot and the stick, are strategies that, as
leaders, we can use to motivate our teams. External motivators generally drive short-term
success, and are useful to kick start progress, or deter a certain behavior or outcome.

Examples of encouraging (carrot) external motivators include: monetary compensation; public
recognition; gifts/prizes

Some examples of discouraging (stick) external motivators include: less desirable schedule;
corrective actions/write ups; demotion or termination

COMMUNICATION 45 minutes

As an Operations Manager and leader in your club, communication is one of the most
important tools you have as a leader. Effective communication isn't just about giving
instructions. It's about building connections with your team, listening to their needs, and
fostering an environment of trust and respect. Leaders communicate by being:

Clear: Great leaders make sure their messages are clear and understood. Whether you're
setting expectations, providing feedback, or explaining a new process, your team needs to
understand what's expected of them.

» You have to ask follow up or clarifying questions to ensure you were clear - as the
communicator it is YOUR responsibility to ensure your message is heard correctly.

Consistent: Consistency in your communication helps avoid confusion and keeps everyone
on the same page.

» Nothing will undermine what you are trying to accomplish faster than if you give
different messages to different teammates - no one will know for sure what to believe
or do.

Open to a Dialogue: Leadership isn't just about talking—it's also about listening. Make
sure your team feels heard by actively listening to their concerns, suggestions, and ideas.
Having two-way conversations shows your team that their thoughts are important and
helps them feel responsible for their work.

» Suppressing questions or concerns doesn't make them go away, it just makes your
team trust you less

Motivational and Supportive: Communication is one of the important ways leaders
inspire their teams. Use your words to motivate your team, offering encouragement and
recognition when they succeed. Support them when challenges arise by providing
guidance and showing confidence in their abilities.

» You are the leader for a reason! Tell them what they are doing well (Positive, Specific)
and work shoulder-to-shoulder to help them achieve success

Transparent and Honest: Being open with your team builds trust. Whether you are
communicating about the club’s goals, performance expectations, or changes in
operations. Honesty helps create an open and supportive environment. Your team will
appreciate knowing they can rely on you for truthful and straightforward communication.

» This does NOT mean you share your concerns or doubts with them, as a leader, you
share those up, not down. Even if they point out the same concerns, acknowledge and
let them know you are working with your leader to find solutions - never commiserate
or pile on.

DELEGATION 30 minutes

One of the hardest things to learn as you manage and lead others is how to let go og doing
everything yourself and effectively handing over certain tasks to others. We have all had the
bosses who only hand over the mundane grunt work (stuff everyone hates to do) and bosses
who do everything themselves. This leads to a lack of productivity for the leader and a lack of
development and engagement for the teammate. Both bad outcomes.

Delegation: Interactive, coaching, two-way communication, pride, big-picture, encouraging,
ownership

Delegation increases the engagement of your team, especially high performers, not to mention
it can take weight off your shoulders as you no longer have to closely manage every detail at
your club

VS

Direction: top down, instructive, high one-way communication, detailed, to-the-point,
checklist, black & white

Sometimes, especially with new or under performing teammates direction is a better path, but
beware of only directing and not delegating. You will not really get any weight off of your to do
list as you must constantly monitor and re-direct.

Dumping: punitive, repetitive, low one-way communication, un-inspiring, unclear, gray in
nature

Dumping is when a leader pawns off an unpleasant or annoying task ,with no real direction or
clarity. Their only real goal is not to have to do it themselves. Sometimes leaders will dump tasks
that they themselves are uncomfortable with or do not understand, leading to long-term issues.

What are some examples of each that you have experienced in your work past (or present)?
