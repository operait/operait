Teammates should request a religious \naccommodation from their immediate Supervisor or the People Team.  Fitness Connectio n may require documentation \nto support the request . \nHARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION  AND RETALIATION  \nFitness Connection is committed to providing a work environment that is free of harass ment and discrimination.

The hours worked \nby hourly Teammates will continue t o be evaluated on an on -going basis for purposes of benefit  eligibility . \nTEAMMATE PERSONNEL  FILE S \nFitness Connection maintains a personnel file for each of its Teammates. Active Teammates who wish to review their \nown personnel file should contact the People Team. Unless otherwise required by law, with reasonable advance notice, \nTeammates may review the ir own personnel files in Fitness Connection’s offices and in the presence of an individual \nappointed by Fitness Connection to maintain the files.

The pay periods are the 1st through the 15th of the month (paid \non or before the 25th of the same month), and the 16th through the last day of the month (paid on or before the 10th of \nthe following month).  The workweek for Payroll purposes begins at 12:00 a.m. on Sunday and ends at the completion \nof the following Saturday.  \nHourly Teammates are responsible for ensuring that their clock -in and clock -out entries accurately reflect all hours \nworked. In the event that there is an error in the amount of pay reported or received, the Teammate should promptly \nbring the discrepancy t o the attention of their Supervisor, Department Manag er or the Payroll Department so that the \ncorrection(s) can be made as quickly as possible. In order to ensure that all wages are paid on a timely basis, each \nTeammate must timely complete and submit a Fo rm W -4 and any other information requested by the Company.  \nIn the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a holiday or weekend, Teammates will receive pay on the first \navailable date prior to the scheduled pay date ( e.g., if the scheduled Friday is a bank holiday, pay would be issued on \nthe prior Thursday) . \nMETHOD OF  PAYMENT  \nTeammates  may  have  pay directly  deposited  into their  bank  accounts  if they  provide  advance  written  authorization  to \nthe Company via their online employee portal. If you choose direct deposit, your semi -monthly check will be deposited \ninto your checking or savings account, or split between multiple accounts as you instruct. Any court -ordered wage \ngarnishments will be processed as required by law.  \nTeammates who enroll in direct deposit will not receive a paper paystub but will be able to view and print their current \nand prior wage statements online.   Teammates who do not elect direct deposition will be issued a paper paycheck . ",
  "page_10": "   \n \n \nFITNESS CONNECTION | HR HANDBOOK  \nUpdated March 2022  6 TEAMMATE  TIMEKEEPING  \nFitness Connection provides non -exempt Teammates with an electronic timekeeping system (via the online employee \nportal) to accurately record all hours worked. This electronic timekeeping device records all time worked and provides \nthe basis for calculating  all compensation due. Unless a separate policy is applicable to your department, the following \nrules must be observed regarding timekeeping:  \n• All clock -in entries should be made immediately before beginning work, and all clock -out time entries \nshould be made immediately after concluding work.  \n• Teammates should not begin work or clock -in earlier than five (5) minutes before their scheduled shift, or \nwork or clock out later than five (5) minutes after the end of their scheduled shift, unless they receive prior \napproval from their Supervisor. Viola tion of this rule may result in corrective action.  \n• Teammates must clock in for and report all hours worked. No “off the clock” work is allowed, and no \nTeammate  may volunteer  to work on their own time for any reason.  Under -reporting and over -reporting \nhours worked, for any reason, is strictly prohibited. If you are ever asked or instructed to work “off the \nclock,” or to under -report or over -report hours worked, or if you beco me aware of such a situation, you \nmust immediately report it to the People Team.  Certain voluntary charitable functions outside of the  \nworkplace may be an exception to this rule, provided the Teammate engages in duties different than their \nregular job.  \n• Teammates must clock out for all meal periods in excess of 30 minutes or when leaving the premises for \npersonal reasons.  \n• Overtime must be authorized by the Teammate’s Supervisor before it is worked. Working overtime without \nprior authorization is a violation of this policy and may result in corrective action. (See Overtime policy \nbelow for more detail.)  \n• Any time entry mistakes must be addressed and corrected by the appropriate supervisor and the affected \nTeammate promptly.  \n• Teammates are prohibited from clocking in or out for any other Teammate.  \n• Any falsification of time records is strictly prohibited.  \nTime spent attending voluntary or non -business -related events is unpaid when attendance at such events is not \nrequired. For example, time spent voluntarily attending a non -mandatory holiday party is unpaid time.  \nEach Teammate is responsible for checking the accuracy and completeness of their own time entries and making the \nnecessary corrections on a timely basis (within the pay period of discrepancy, if possible). Should you have any \nquestions regarding this polic y, please contact the People Team .  \nMEAL PERIOD & REST BREAKS  \nTo ensure Teammates are well rested and refreshed during their shifts, Fitness Connection provides meal periods and \nrest breaks to Club Teammates. Below are the Company’s general policies regarding meal periods and rest breaks . \nMeal Periods  \nFitness Connection provides meal periods to Teammates in accordance with applicable law. Uninterrupted meal \nperiods in excess of 30 minutes are unpaid and do not count as hours worked when calculating overtime pay. \nTeammates must clock out during their meal period  and cannot remain in their work areas or perform any work \nduring this time .   \nRest Breaks  \nFitness Connection provides rest breaks to Teammates in accordance with applicable law. Given the nature of the \nbusiness, Teammates must let their Supervisor on duty know when they plan to take a rest break during their shift, ",

Rest breaks are on -\nthe-clock and must not exceed 10 minutes. Teammates should arrange any incidental personal activities that are \ncarried out at work to corresp ond with their rest break, as practicable. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of \nwork periods and may not be combined with a meal period. Additionally, meal periods and rest breaks must never \nbe taken at the beginning or end of a shift . \nTeammates and their Supervisors are expected to anticipate the need to take rest periods and coordinate them as \nbusiness necessitates . \nNURSING MOTHERS  \nFitness Connection is committed to providing a caring environment for all Teammates that simultaneously aligns with \nthe Company’s inclusion initiative. This policy establishes a “Mother -Friendly” Teammate worksite lactation support \nprogram. Fitness Connect ion recognizes that breastfeeding a baby is a basic and important act of nature and must be \nencouraged in the interest of the mother and child’s health. Fitness Connection also recognizes a mother’s \nresponsibility to both her job and her child upon returni ng to work and acknowledges the benefits that breastfeeding \nbrings to families, employers and society in general . \nAtmosphere of Support  \nFitness Connection supports worksite breastfeeding and/or expression of a mother’s milk and encourages \nTeammates and Management to have a positive and accepting attitude toward this practice. Discrimination or \nharassment of breastfeeding mothers in any for m is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Fitness Connection \nspecifically prohibits the following:  \n• Adverse employment actions of any kind as a result of reasonable time used for lactation  \n• Acts of discrimination or retaliation against lactating mothers or those who may become lactating mothers  \n• Disapproving comments or criticisms of staff who use reasonable time for lactation  \n• Jokes, comments, or ridicule that may result in embarrassment for lactating mothers or other staff  \n \nTime and Leave  \nWork schedule and work pattern flexibility will be provided to accommodate reasonable break times for a Teammate \nto express breastmilk for her nursing child or to breastfeed, each time such Teammate has the need to express milk \nor breastfeed, for up to one  (1) year after the child’s birth, unless additional time is required under applicable state \nlaw. \n• Lactating  mothers  may  use time  during  their  standard  workday  for milk  expression. For non-exempt \nTeammates,  this may  include  various combinations  of standard  paid  break  periods,  lunch  periods,  and \nunpaid  breaks  as reasonably  necessary.  Exempt Teammates may take breaks as needed for such purpose . \n• For non -exempt Teammates, lactation time beyond the regular paid break time is unpaid and will be \ncommunicated between the Teammate  and their  Supervisor  for approval.  The Teammate’s  Supervisor  will \nprovide  the Teammate  with  the appropriate clock in and out procedures, if  necessary  \n• Non -exempt Teammates may make up any unpaid time off for milk expression, if desired, as determined \nand approved by their supervisors. Scheduling will be arranged on a case -by-case basis and be based on \nthe specific needs of the Teammate. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the duties of the \nlactating Teammate are covered during their expression  breaks  \nFacilities, Including Breastmilk Storage  \nFitness Connection  will provide  a private,  accessible  area  that is not a bathroom, reasonably free from dirt and \npollution, and that is shielded  from  view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public,  for the purpose  of \nexpressing  breastmilk  or breastfeeding.

As with  any personal  item, handling and supervision of the \npump and supply equipment is the sole responsibility of the  Teammate.  \nIf Teammates have questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the People Team . \nTRAVEL POLICY  \nAll Teammates will be reimbursed for all reasonable travel -related costs incurred, per our Travel Policy  \nOVERTIME  \nNon -exempt Teammates may be required to work overtime. All overtime must be approved by your Supervisor in \nadvance of the hours being worked. Working overtime without prior authorization may result in corrective action, up to \nand including termination.  \nFitness Connection follows applicable state and federal laws regarding the calculation and payment of overtime. \nGenerally, overtime is defined as any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a given workweek. Teammates will receive \none and one half (1 ½) time s their regular hourly rate for time worked over 40 hours in a workweek.  Fitness Connection \ndoes not permit non -exempt Teammates to take time off in lieu of receiving overtime pay.  \nIf a non -exempt Teammate has two (2) or more different pay rates during the workweek and works overtime, the \nTeammate will receive one and one half times the regular hourly rate associated with the job that caused the overtime \nto occur. Where required by l aw, the regular hourly rate will be calculated using the weighted average method, taking \ninto account the Teammate’s different hourly rates, hours worked and other pay that must be considered by law.  \nExempt Teammates are paid a fixed salary that is intended to cover all of the compensation to which they are entitled, \nregardless of the number of hours worked. Because they are exempt, such Teammates are not entitled to additional \ncompensation or time off for hours worked . \nADMINISTRATIVE PAY CORRECTIONS  \nFitness Connection takes all reasonable steps to ensure its Teammates receive the correct amount of pay in each \npaycheck and that Teammates are paid promptly on the scheduled payday.   \nReview your pay stub when you receive it.  In the event there is an error in the amount of pay ( e.g., overpayment, \nunderpayment, or improper deduction), you should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of your Supervisor \n(prior to the next pay period if possible).  If no action is taken or you believe the action taken is incorrect, contact the \nPeople Team so that corrections can be made as quickly as possible.  \nEvery report of a pay error will be investigated and errors found will be corrected.  In addition, the Company will not \nallow any form of retaliation against Teammates who report alleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the \nCompany’s investiga tion of such reports . \nWORK  SCHEDULES  \nTeammates are expected to follow and work their assigned schedules. It may be necessary at times for Fitness \nConnection to modify a Teammate’s work assignments or schedule, and Fitness Connection reserves the right to assign \nTeammates to work hours consist ent with the demands of the business. This may result in the Teammate working \nmore or less than their scheduled hours, working a variety of shifts, or working on days previously scheduled to be off. \nManagement approval must be received prior to changing sc hedules with a co -worker .

  "page_13": "   \n \n \nFITNESS CONNECTION | HR HANDBOOK  \nUpdated March 2022  9 ACTIVE NO PAY  REPORT  \nThere are times when Teammates fail to report for duty or contact Management regarding their employment status. \nFitness Connection must ensure its employment roster is accurate for various reasons, including but not limited to Club \nscheduling, benefits man agement, unemployment insurance, and overall data integrity.  \nThe Payroll Team will run an ‘Active No Pay Report’ every month. Teammates who appear on the Active – No Pay Report \nfor three (3) consecutive pay periods will be separated, unless they are on an approved leave or unless otherwise \nprohibited by law . \nEMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION AND/OR REFERENCES  \nAll requests for employment verifications and/or references must be directed to The Work Number \nwww.theworknumber.com : \n• Employer Name : Titan Fitness DBA Fitness Connection  \n• Employer Code: 25639  \n• Teammate  User ID: SSN (your social security  number)  \n• Teammate  Default PIN: last 4 SSN + 4 digit birth year (8 digits in  total)  \nIn response to a request for employment verification and/or references through The Work Number, Fitness Connection’s \npolicy is to provide only the dates of employment and the title of the position last held. Fitness Connection may, in its \ndiscretion, relea se additional information after express written or email authorization by the former Teammate . \nATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY  \nAttendance and punctuality are crucial to Fitness Connection’s efficient operation. Without commitment to a policy of \nprompt and ready attendance at work, we will be unable to meet our goal of providing exceptional Guest service. To \naccomplish this goal, w e require all Teammates to strictly follow our procedures regarding tardiness, leaving early, and \nabsenteeism.  \nAmong other things, tardiness, leaving a scheduled or unscheduled shift early, or returning late from a break without a \nSupervisor’s permission are prohibited. In the event that a Teammate is unable to arrive at work on time as scheduled, \nthe Teammate must provide their Supervisor with reasonable notice of tardiness, which in most circumstances will b e \nat least 30 minutes prior to the Teammate’s scheduled shift. Repeated tardiness or failure to properly notify a Supervisor \nwithin the time guideline set out above or leaving work early without advance permission, may subject a Teammate to \ncorrective acti on, up to and including termination.  \nIf the Teammate is unable to report to work as scheduled due to sickness or other emergency, they must notify their \nSupervisor as soon as possible, which in most circumstances will be at least two (2) hours before the scheduled shift. \nIn an extreme emergen cy where the Teammate is unable to come to the phone, they should have someone else notify \ntheir Supervisor of the absence within the same timeframe. If the Supervisor is unavailable, the Teammate or their \nrepresentative should leave a voicemail explaining  the situation. To protect the health of our Members and Teammates, \nFitness Connection expects Teammates to take time off if they are sick.  \nAbsences of more  than  three (3) consecutive scheduled shifts without proper notification (i.e., no -call/ no -show) will \ngenerally be considered a voluntary resignation due to job abandonment.  In extreme circumstances, Fitness \nConnection will consider the explanation and its ti ming before determining if the voluntary resignation will be upheld.  \nFor absences of more than three (3) consecutive workdays, you may be required to provide a physician’s note in order \nfor you to return to work.  \nFitness Connection has complete discretion to determine when absences or tardiness are excessive and what, if any, \ncorrective action is appropriate  ",

However, due to the nature of Fitness Connections’ business, regular attendance and promptness \nare considered indispe nsable to the ability of each Teammate to perform their essential job functions .  \nCELL PHONE/MOBILE DEVICE  USE/RECORDINGS  \nAlthough Teammates are permitted to carry their mobile phone or smartphone on their person while working, the use \nof such devices for personal reasons is limited to approved Rest Breaks and Meal Periods only. Further, such devices \nmust be kept out of view of Members and Guests at all times. If a Teammate has an urgent situation that  requires use \nof their phone while working ( e.g., pregnant spouse, etc.), they must receive prior approval from their Supervisor for \nsuch use. In those cases, the mobile device still should not be visible to Members. It should be kept in the Teammate’s \npocket and the ringer and/or alarm should be set on ”vibrate” mode.  Teammates are encouraged to leave other \nvaluables at home to reduce the risk of theft or loss.  The Company assumes no responsibility for the theft, loss or \ndamages of Teammates’ personal pr operty.  \nAny use of a cell phone, camera phone or other digital or electronic device for taking photos or videos may only occur \nin public areas of the Club during non -working time unless otherwise authorized by Fitness Connection (or requested \nby a Guest, e.g., to take a photo of an event). Due to the potential for issues such as invasion of privacy (Teammate and \nMember), sexual or other harassment (as defined by our harassment and discrimination policies in this Handbook), \nprotection of proprietary materials a nd op erations, Teammates may not take, distribute, or post pictures, videos, or \naudio recordings of non -public areas. Further, recording Fitness Connection meetings or conversations without express \nauthorization of the other parties involved is prohibited. An e xception to the rule concerning pictures and recordings of \nwork areas would be to engage in activity protected by the National Labor Relations Act, including, for example, taking \npictures or making recordings of health, safety, and/or working condition con cerns, or of a strike, protest, or other \nprotected concerted activities. Under no circumstances may the display of pornographic material, nudity or other \nsexually suggestive images on a camera or mobile device be shown while on Company premises.  \nTeammates who drive a motor vehicle during the course of their workday or while performing work -related errands are \nstrictly prohibited from using a cell phone or other mobile device while driving, unless the device has a designated \nhands -free function. An y device used while driving must be configured to allow hands free listening and talking. When \ndriving a vehicle, Teammates are not permitted to send or read text or email messages. Teammates should also refrain \nfrom using a mobile device in adverse weathe r or traffic conditions. Teammates must also abide by state and local \nlaws regarding use of mobile devices.  \nSee also Fitness Connection’s Bring Your Own Device policy (as may be amended from time to time), which is \nincorporated herein by reference . \nPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN  TEAMMATE S  \nPersonal relationships  between  Teammates,  romantic  or otherwise , have the potential to cause conflicts of interest, \ndistractions that interfere with productivity, and potential charges of harassment or unfair treatment. Fitness \nConnection reserves the right to address the employment status of any Teammate whose outside relationship(s) has \nan actual or potential adverse impact on Fitness Connection.  \nSupervisors are prohibited from dating or pursuing or maintaining a romantic or sexual relationship with Teammates \nwhom they supervise, either directly or indirectly. Supervisors are also prohibited from cohabitating with Teammates \nwhom they supervise, eit her directly or indirectly. Any such prohibited relationship or cohabitation must be reported to \nFitness Connection immediately.  \nIf a Teammate is currently involved in a romantic or sexual relationship with a co -worker ( i.e., not a Teammate they \ndirectly or indirectly supervise, or to whom they directly or indirectly report), or if a Teammate becomes interested in \nengaging in such a relationship, they must advise their Supervisor and complete Fitness Connection’s Relationship  \nDisclosure Form.

In addition to \nclaims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day -\nto-day working relationships. In the e vent of actual or potential problems related to the employment of Teammates who \nmaintain a familial or close relationship, Fi tness Connection will take prompt action within its sole discretion. This can \ninclude position change or, if necessary, termination of employment for one or both of the individuals involved.  \nManagers may not supervise, either directly or indirectly, a relative at the same Club or in the same Team  Support Center  \nDepartment.

Depending u pon the nature of the search, some job postings may be opened internally and externally. A \njob posting often provides Supervisors with an effective way to identify qualified internal Teammates. It also provides \nan opportunity for Teammates to advance their  careers with Fitness Connection by applying for open opportunities. \nTeammates are encouraged to discuss their career goals with their Supervisor and the People Team in advance of \napplying for open positions .   \nEligibility to Apply  \nYou may apply for any posted position, provided you meet the following eligibility requirements : \n• You must notify your current Supervisor or Department Head  (Team  Support Center)  of your intention to \napply for the posted position.  \n• Your performance  must meet current position expectations.  \n• You must  meet the minimum qualifications as stated in the job posting;  and \n• You must  be in good standing including, but not limited to, you may not be on any type of improvement \nplan or subject to any corrective action for performance within 60 of the posting of such position (or such \nother timeframe as set forth by the People Team)  \nINTERNAL  TRANSFERS  \nFitness Connection  supports  Teammate  transfers  for personal  reasons,  advancement  opportunities  and to cover  \nbusiness  needs.

There are \nmany different interpretations and perceptions of appropriate attire and appearance. We respect our Teammate’s right \nto individual expression. However, our intention is to provide the Fitness Connection team with some guidelines as to \nwhat represents an appropriate presentation to Members and Guests so that Teammates’ professional attire is suitable \nand does not interfere with their safety or th e safety of others.  For more details about the appearance and grooming \nguidelines, see Fitness Connection’s Appearance and Grooming Policy (as may be amended from time to time), which \nis incorporated herein by reference . \nWORKPLACE ETIQUETTE  \nFitness Connection strives to maintain a positive work environment where Teammates treat everyone in the workplace \nwith respect and professionalism. Teammates are expected to perform their work in a cooperative manner with \nManagement/Supervisors, coworkers , Vendors, and Guests. Sometimes issues arise when Teammates are unaware \nthat their behavior in the workplace is disruptive or annoying to others. Many of these day -to-day issues can be \naddressed by politely talking with a co -worker to bring the perceived problem to their attention. In most cases, common \nsense will dictate an appropriate resolution. Fitness Connection encourages all Teammates to keep an open mind and \ngraciously accept constructive feedback or a request to change behavior that may be affecti ng another Teammate's \nability to concentrate and be productive.  \nThe following workplace etiquette guidelines are not necessarily intended to be hard -and-fast work rules with \ncorrective consequences. They are simply suggestions for appropriate workplace behavior to help everyone be more \nconscientious and considerate of co-workers and the work environment . \n• In the breakroom; wash cups, dishes, and utensils after  use. \n• Clean offices and return them to a neat, orderly condition immediately after use.  \n• Remove all papers, cups, plates, leftover food, etc., and thoroughly wipe down tables if food was eaten \nduring a  meeting.  \n• Keep the area around the copy machine and printer orderly and picked  up. \n• Be conscious  of how your  voice  travels and  try to lower  the volume  of your voice when talking on the phone \nor to others in open  areas.  \n• Keep socializing  to a minimum and try to conduct conversations in areas where the noise will not be \ndistracting to  others.  \n• Notify your Supervisor immediately of any damage to office equipment or fixtures so that appropriate \nrepairs can be made quickly . \n \nCORRECTIVE ACTION AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT  \nFitness Connection may impose corrective action whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate. \nCorrective action may take various forms, including verbal or written counseling, suspension, demotion, transfer, \nreassignment or termination. T he corrective action imposed will depend on the circumstances of each case; therefore, \ncorrective action will not necessarily be imposed in any particular sequence. Moreover, at any time the Company \ndetermines it is appropriate, a Teammate may be discharge d immediately.  ",

To promote this goal, Teammates \nare required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a safe and \nsatisfactory manner. Te ammates whose positions with Fitness Connection require driving on Company business may \nbe removed from such positions if found to have been driving, whether on duty or off duty, under the influence of alcohol \nor drugs (including illegal drugs, or prescrip tion or over -the-counter drugs if used other than as prescribed or in an \nunsafe manner).  \nIllegal Drugs:  \nThe use, possession, purchase, attempted purchase, transfer, attempted transfer or manufacture of any illegal drug \nby a Teammate is prohibited on Fitness Connection’s premises, in any Company -controlled areas, while driving on \nCompany time, while operating  Fitness Connection equipment, and while performing any Fitness Connection \nbusiness or work.  Examples of illegal drugs include cocaine, marijuana, and prescription drugs not lawfully obtained.  \nPlease note that state laws decriminalizing marijuana for those with a prescription or for personal use have no \nimpact on Fitness Connection’s policy prohibiting the possession or use of marijuana at work, being under the \ninfluence of marijuana at work, or  having any detectable level of marijuana in a Teammate’s system, unless required \nunder state law.  Most state laws do not require Fitness Connection to accommodate the medical use of marijuana, \nand marijuana is still illegal under federal law, with or wit hout a prescription . \nPrescription and Over -The-Counter Drugs:  \nExcept for marijuana, which is addressed above, legal drugs are those prescribed by a physician or over -the-counter \ndrugs that are legally obtained by the Teammate and used for the purpose for which they were prescribed and sold. \nEven legal drugs can affect the safety of a Teammate, co -workers or the public. Therefore, any Teammate who is \ntaking a legal drug that might impair safety, performance, or any motor functions must advise their Supervisor before \nreporting to work under the influence of that medicat ion. Teammates using medication prescribed by a licensed \nphysician may be required to provide Management with proof that such medication is safe to take while the \nTeammate is on duty. Management reserves the right to determine whether or not it will be saf e for a Teammate to \nremain on duty while under the influence of a particular medication or over -the-counter drug . ",

This policy does not prohibit the use or \nconsumption of alcohol at such events, whether on or outside of Fitness Connection premises.  However, if \nTeammates choose to consume alcohol at such events, they must do so responsibly and maintain their obligation \nto conduct themselves properly and professionally at all times with cow orkers and any other persons present.  \nTeammates who take the initiative of advising their Supervisor in advance that they have a medical problem with \nregard to alcohol or drug use and who demonstrate a commitment to take the necessary remedial action prior to \nengaging in the above behavior whi le at work, may be eligible for a medical leave of absence for such purpose . \nTesting for Drugs and Alcohol  \nTo ensure the safety of the work environment, the Company reserves the right to require a Teammate to submit to \na urine and/or blood test for drugs or alcohol, at an offsite facility, whenever reasonable suspicion exists that a \nTeammate is under the influe nce of alcohol or drugs. We reserve the right to require a Teammate involved in an on -\nthe-job accident to submit to a blood and/or urine test. The definition of “accident” is an unplanned event that results \nin property damage or bodily injury.  \nRefusal to submit to a blood and/or urine test will result in a presumption that the Teammate is under the influence \nof drugs or alcohol.  \nBy submitting to a blood and/or urine test, the Teammate authorizes the release of the test results and any \ninterpretation of the results by the testing facility to Company personnel to determine whether the Teammate has \nviolated Company policy on drug and  alcohol use. Additionally, the Teammate releases the Company and its \nDirectors, Officers, agents, Teammates, and the persons conducting the test(s) from any claims, demands, causes \nof action, and any and all damages that may result from the test(s) or the  disclosure of the results or interpretation \nof the test(s). Teammates will be provided with a copy of the test results. Otherwise, test results will remain \nconfidential, to the extent required by state law.  \nA positive test result will constitute evidence of a violation of this policy. A Teammate may offer an explanation for \na positive test result, but there is no guarantee that the Teammate’s explanation will prevent corrective action or \ntermination. Nothing in this policy requires the Company to conduct drug and/or alcohol testing of a Teammate \nwhen there is other evidence of a violation of this policy . \nTeammate Assistance Program  \nFitness Connection cares about the welfare of its Teammates.

Any  activity that is fully disclosed in writing to, and is approved by, the People Team will not be deemed \nto involve a conflict of interest for the purposes of this policy . \nVendor Relationships & Gifts  \nFitness Connection understands the importance of maintaining a professional relationship with its Vendors. It is \ncommon business practice that Vendors or potential Vendors may occasionally provide gifts, products or \nentertainment of nominal value to our Te ammates. Vendors may also provide travel expenses to Teammates for \nattending a business -related event. Teammates must be aware, however, that acceptance of Vendor gifts, products, \nentertainment or services of an excessive value may create a conflict of int erest or create the perception of \nimpropriety among co -workers and the industry, even though no impropriety in the relationship may actually exist. \nTherefore, Teammates who receive gifts that value $250 or more, and any paid travel expenses, must be report ed \nto and approved by Legal and Finance/Accounting .

To the  extent  possible,  notify  your  Supervisor  of your desired  PTO at least  14 days in \nadvance.  If the absence is unexpected ( i.e., due to illness or injury), less advance notice is understandable and \nexpected. In these cases, Teammates must notify their Supervisor as soon as possible, which in most circumstances \nwill be at least two (2) hours before the scheduled shift.  \nTeammates are responsible for accurately recording all PTO. PTO may be used in minimum increments of one (1) \nhour.  Requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs and staffing requirements. \nFitness Connection reserves the right to approve or deny any PTO request based on operational requirements and \nstaffing needs.  \nPTO will not be counted as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime.  \nTeammates who change their employment status from full -time to part -time will retain any PTO granted as of the \ndate of such employment status change. All retained PTO must be used prior to the Teammate’s hire anniversary \ndate. If the Teammate returns to fu ll-time employment at a later date, all previous years of service will be applied \nwhen determining the amount of PTO that should be granted.  \nPart -time Teammates do not qualify for PTO but may take time off if it is approved by their Supervisor. Part -time \nTeammates who change their employment status to full -time will have all previous years of service applied when \ndetermining the amount of PTO t hat should be granted.  \nPaid leave requirements that are city/state specific will be managed accordingly in those geographic areas.  Under \nthose laws/regulations, paid leave may be available to those who are not otherwise eligible for the Fitness \nConnection PTO policy.  Contact t he People Team for available options.  \nUpon termination of employment, whether the termination is voluntary or involuntary, all accrued PTO is forfeited,  \nand such unused PTO will not be paid out upon termination of employment, or at any other time, unless otherwise \nrequired by applicable state law.  \nFitness Connection reserves the right to request medical documentation/certification from Teammates for \nabsences due to illness or injury . \nV. LEAVES OF ABSENCE  \nFitness Connection  recognizes that family and personal situations may sometimes necessitate more lengthy absences. \nThe following policies outline the requirements for obtaining a leave of absence, the amount of leave that may be taken, \nand how the leave relates to other time  off provided by the Company. Each situation is evaluated on an individual basis \nand on its merits. Authorized leaves of absences include: Family and Medical Leave, Non -FMLA Medical Leave, Personal \nLeave and Uniformed Services Leave.

All  Teammates are welcome to use any available FTO or PTO, as applicable and as required under \nthe policies set forth above. Your Supervisor may approve additional unpaid time off. Proof of death and relationship to \nthe deceased may be required. For purposes of this policy, family member includes a Teammate’s current spouse, \ndomestic partner, child, sibling, parent, legal guardian, grandparent, stepparent, stepchild, father -in-law, mother -in-law, \nbrother -in-law, sister -in-law, son -in-law, daughter -in-law and g randparent . \nFAMILY & MEDICAL LEAVE ACT  (FMLA)  \nFitness Connection  complies  with  the provisions  of the Family  and Medical  Leave  Act (“FMLA ”) of 1993.  The FMLA  \nentitles  eligible  Teammates  to take  up to an aggregate  of 12 work weeks  of job-protected  leave  in a 12 -month period for \nspecified family and medical reasons or other qualifying exigencies, or up to 26 weeks for certain  military -related  \nmedical  reasons.  Fitness Connection  calculates  FMLA  leave  on a rolling  backward  method,  which  means that a \nTeammate’s 12 -month period is measured backward from the date any FMLA leave is  used.  \nEligibility  \nTeammates are eligible if they:  \n• Work at a Fitness Connection location where there are 50 or more Teammates working within 75 miles;  \nand \n• Have worked at Fitness Connection for at least 12 months as of the date the FMLA leave is to start (does \nnot need to be consecutive);  and \n• Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the FMLA  leave.  \nTeammate Notice  \nIf the need  for FMLA  is foreseeable,  Fitness Connection requires 30 days’ advance notice to the Teammate’s \nSupervisor and the Benefits team. If leave is unforeseeable, the Teammate must give notice of the need as soon as \npracticable.  \nGeneral Leave Entitlement  \nPursuant to the FMLA, Fitness Connection will grant an eligible Teammate up to a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid \nleave during the rolling 12 -month period (calculated as described above) for any of the following reasons:  \n• The birth and care of a newborn child of the  Teammate;  \n• Placement with the Teammate of a child for adoption or foster  care;  \n• To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent) with a serious health  condition;  \n• A serious health condition that makes the Teammate unable to perform the functions of their job;  \n• Qualifying exigencies arising from the fact that the Teammate’s immediate family member is a military \nmember on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status.  \nDefinition of “Serious Health Condition”  \nA serious health condition for purposes of the FMLA leave means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental \ncondition that involves one of the following:  \n• an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, and any period of incapacity or \nsubsequent treatment in connection with the overnight stay.

A  visit to the health  care  provider  is not \nnecessary  for each  absence.  \n• Any period of incapacity due to, or treatment for, a chronic serious health condition that continues over an \nextended period of time, requires periodic  visits  to a health  care  provider,  and may  involve  occasional  \nepisodes  of incapacity  (e.g., asthma, diabetes). A visit to the health care provider is not necessary for each  \nabsence.  \n• A period of incapacity which is permanent or long -term due to a condition for which treatment may not be \neffective, but which requires the continuing supervision of a health care provider ( e.g., Alzheimer’s, terminal \ncancer, a severe stroke).  \n• Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or a condition that would likely result in a period of \nincapacity of more than three (3) consecutive, full calendar days if not treated (e.g., chemotherapy,  \nradiation, dialysis,  etc.).  \nMilitary Caregiver Leave Entitlement  \nEligible Teammates are entitled to two types of FMLA leave related to a qualifying family member’s military service.  \nThe first type of leave is known as “Military Caregiver Leave.”  Pursuant to the FMLA, an eligible Teammate who is \nthe spouse, child, pare nt, or next of kin of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness may take up to a \ntotal of 26 workweeks of unpaid leave during a single 12 -month period to care for the covered servicemember. “Next \nof kin” means the servicemember’s nearest blo od relative, other than the servicemember’s spouse, parent, or child, \nand can include siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.  \nIn the context of Military Caregiver Leave, \"serious injury or illness\" means any of the following for an active \nservicemember or veteran:  \n• An injury or illness incurred by the servicemember in the line of duty on active duty that may render the \nservicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of their office, grade, rank or  rating.  \n• A continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was \na member of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember unable to perform the duties of the \nservicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating.  \n• A physical or mental condition for which the veteran has received a VA disability rating of 50% or  greater, \nand the need for care is related to that condition.  \n• A physical or mental condition because of a disability or disabilities related to military service that \nsubstantially impairs the veteran’s ability to work, or would do so absent treatment.  \n• An injury  for which the veteran is enrolled in the VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family \nCaregivers . \nThe \"single 12 -month period\" for Military Caregiver Leave begins on the first day a Teammate takes Military Caregiver \nLeave and ends 12 months after that date. Once a Teammate begins taking leave to care for a covered \nservicemember, the Teammate may take u p to 26 workweeks of leave during the 12 consecutive months following ",

Up to 12 of the 26 workweeks may be for an FMLA -qualifying reason other than to care \nfor a covered servicemember.  \nFor Military Caregiver Leave that also qualifies as leave taken to care for a family member with a serious health \ncondition, employers are required to designate such leave as Military Caregiver Leave first.  \nAs with other types of FMLA leave, Fitness Connection will require that a health care provider complete an \nappropriate certification of the need for Military Caregiver Leave.  \nQualifying Exigency Leave Entitlement  \nThe second type of FMLA related to a qualifying family member’s military service is known as “Qualifying Exigency \nLeave.” An eligible Teammate may take Qualifying Exigency Leave when the Teammate’s spouse, child, or parent \nwho is a member of the Armed Forc es (including the National Guard and Reserves) is on covered active duty or has \nbeen notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty.  \nThere are nine (9) types of “qualifying exigencies” that may qualify for this type of FMLA leave:  \n• Short -notice deployment : leave to address any issue that arises from an impending call or order to active \nduty where the servicemember receives notice of the deployment seven (7) days or less from the date of \ndeployment (available only for a 7 -day period after the date of notice  of deployment).  \n• Military events and related activities : leave to attend any military ceremony, program, or event related to \nthe active duty or call to active -duty status, or to attend certain family support or assistance programs and \ninformational  briefings.  \n• Childcare and school activities : leave to arrange or provide for childcare or school -related activities (the \nchild must be the child of the servicemember).  \n• Parental care : Leave to provide care for the servicemember’s parent who cannot care for  himself/herself.  \n• Financial  and legal  arrangements : leave  to make  or update  various  financial  or legal  arrangements  relating \nto the call to active  duty.  \n• Counseling : leave  to attend  counseling  (provided by  someone  other  than  a health  care  provider)  when  all \ngood  \n•  as a result of the active duty or call to active duty  status.  \n• Rest  and recuperation : leave  to spend  time  with  a covered  servicemember  who  is on short -term,  temporary, \nrest-and-recuperation leave during the period of deployment (up to 15  days).  \n• Post -deployment activities : leave to attend arrival ceremonies (including funeral or memorial services), \nreintegration  briefings  and events,  and any other  official  ceremony  or program  sponsored  by the military  for \na period of 90 days following active -duty status;  and \n• Additional  activities : leave  to address  other  events  arising  from  military  duty  agreed  upon  between  the \nCompany and the Teammate.  \nCertification of Need for Leave  \nEach Teammate requesting FMLA leave due to a medical condition of the Teammate or the Teammate’s spouse, \nchild or  parent  must  provide  certification  from  a health  care  provider  or from  an institution  as set forth  by the \nDepartment of Labor. Additional documentation may be required in some instances. The Benefits team will provide \nthe certification form required to be completed with the eligibility notice. Teammates must return a completed \ncertification within 15 days of receipt. Failure to timely return certification forms can result in a delay or denial of ",

Once the Benefits team has sufficient information to make a determination of whether \nthe absence qualifies as FMLA leave, they will provide a notice of designation within 5 business  days.  \nFitness Connection reserves the right to obtain a second opinion from a different healthcare provider. Fitness \nConnection may also require recertification at certain intervals, including if the Teammate seeks extend the leave of \nabsence beyond what has bee n certified.  \nSubstitution of Paid Leave  \nTeammates must substitute any available PTO for any part of unpaid FMLA leave provided under this policy. \nHowever, if you are currently receiving short -term disability or workers' compensation benefits,  you will not be \nrequired to use accrued PTO during the period in which you are receiving benefits. Once PTO has been exhausted, \nany remaining FMLA leave will be  unpaid.  \nFMLA leave runs concurrently with any other applicable paid or unpaid leave. Using available PTO, short -term \ndisability, or workers'  compensation benefits will not extend your total leave time beyond the maximum of 12 weeks \nallowed under the FMLA.  \nIntermittent FMLA Leave  \nIntermittent FMLA leave is leave taken in increments due to an illness or injury, rather than in one continuous period \nof time. This may include FMLA leave taken on a reduced leave schedule, which means a leave schedule that reduces \nthe hours a Teammate wo rks in a workweek or workday.  \nTo qualify for intermittent leave, the need must be medically necessary due to a serious health condition. Intermittent \nleave may be used to attend appointments with a healthcare provider for necessary treatment of the Teammate’s \nown serious health conditi on or that of a qualifying family member.  Intermittent leave may also be used for \nqualifying exigencies.  \nWhen using this type of leave, Teammates must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt normal business \noperations.  \nBenefits while on FMLA Leave  \nDuring an approved FMLA leave, Fitness Connection will maintain your health and other benefits, as if you continued \nto be actively employed. However, Teammates will be required to pay their portion of insurance premiums during \nthe leave. (If you are substi tuting accrued PTO for the unpaid FMLA leave, your share of premiums will be paid by \nthe method normally used during any paid leave – i.e., a payroll deduction.)  If you return to work owing any \ncontributions for your portion of insurance premiums that the  Company made to maintain coverage during your \nleave, you will be required to catch up on your premiums payments through payroll deduction(s).  \nPTO will not accrue during FMLA leave.  \nReinstatement  \nAt the beginning of FMLA leave, the Teammate must inform Fitness Connection of their expected return date. Upon \nreturn from FMLA leave, the Teammate will be reinstated to either their former position or an equivalent position \nwith equivalent pay, benefits,  and other terms and conditions of employment.  \nUse of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that a Teammate earned or was entitled to \nbefore using FMLA leave. In addition, FMLA leave will not be counted against a Teammate for purposes of the \nCompany’s attendance and punctuali ty policies.  \nIf a Teammate has taken FMLA leave for their own serious health condition, Fitness Connection requires that, upon \nreturn from leave, the Teammate present a fitness -for-duty medical certification, signed by the Teammate’s \nhealthcare provider, clearing the T eammate to return to work and perform all essential functions.

This fact -specific determination will be made by Fitness Connection on a case -\nby-case  basis.  \nRetaliation  \nFitness Connection strictly prohibits and does not tolerate unlawful retaliation against any Teammate. All forms of \nunlawful retaliation are prohibited, including any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation or other forms of retaliation \nfor participatin g in any activity protected by the FMLA . \nLEAVE AS AN ACCOMODATION  \nThe Americans  with  Disabilities  Act and the Americans  with  Disabilities  Amendments  Act are federal laws that prohibit \ndiscrimination against job applicants and Teammates with disabilities, and require the provision of reasonable \naccommodations to job applicants and Teammates who are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable \naccommodations, so that they may perform the essential duties of the  position. Fitness Connection is committed to \ncomplying with all applicable laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities.  \nAs set forth in the Disability and Religious Accommodation policy above, Fitness Connection will reasonably \naccommodate qualified individuals with a disability so that they can perform the essential functions  of a job, unless  \ndoing  so causes  a direct  threat  to these  individuals  or others  in the workplace  and the threat cannot be eliminated by \nreasonable accommodation, or unless the accommodation creates an undue hardship for the Company. One type of \naccommodation that may be provided is a leave of absence.  \nLeave as an accommodation applies only to Teammates who do not meet the eligibility requirements under Fitness \nConnection’s other leave policies or who have exhausted available leave under the other leave policies. A Teammate \nmay request a leave of absence  or an extension of a leave of absence as an accommodation for a disability if such \nleave would allow the Teammate to return to work following leave and perform the essential functions of the \nTeammate’s position. In order to be eligible for leave as a reas onable accommodation, you must request it from Fitness \nConnection and engage in the interactive process to determine whether a period of definite and temporary leave is \nreasonably likely to allow you to return to work and perform the essential functions of your position. Leave granted as \na reasonable accommodation cannot be for more than thirty (30) day increments without both parties further engaging \nin the interactive process. Limiting leave to such increments promotes frequent communication regarding the  \nTeammate’s progress and whether the period of leave continues to be a reasonable accommodation under the \ncircumstances. To obtain leave under this policy, the Teammate must cooperate with the Company to obtain medical \ninformation substantiating:  \n• the nature of  impairment;  \n• the functions the Teammate cannot  perform;  \n• the amount of time the Teammate will have the  restrictions;  \n• an estimated return -to-work  date;  \n• the level of confidence of the physician regarding these details;  and \n• estimated restrictions that will still exist after the Teammate is released to  return (if any).
